  -concurrency N	Set the maximum number of concurrent games to N
  -draw movenumber=NUMBER movecount=COUNT score=SCORE
			Adjudicate the game as a draw if the score of both
			engines is within SCORE centipawns from zero for at
			least COUNT consecutive moves, and at least NUMBER full
			moves have been played. Captures and pawn moves will
			reset the counters.
  -resign movecount=COUNT score=SCORE [twosided=VALUE]
			Adjudicate the game as a loss if an engine's score is
			at least SCORE centipawns below zero for at least COUNT
			consecutive moves.
			If VALUE is true (default: false) then activate
			two-sided resign adjudication: The scores of the winning
			side must be at least SCORE centipawns above zero for at
			least COUNT consecutive moves.
  -maxmoves N		Adjudicate the game as a draw if the game is still
			ongoing after N or more full moves have been played.
			This limit is not in action if set to zero.
  -tb PATHS		Adjudicate games using Syzygy tablebases. PATHS should
			be semicolon-delimited list of paths to the compressed
			tablebase files. Only the WDL tablebase files are
			required.
  -tbpieces N		Only use tablebase adjudication for positions with
			N pieces or less.
  -tbignore50		Disable the fifty move rule for tablebase adjudication.
  -tournament TYPE	Set the tournament type to TYPE, which can be one of:
			'round-robin': Round-robin tournament (default)
			'gauntlet': First engine(s) against the rest
			'knockout': Single-elimination tournament.
			'pyramid': Every engine plays against all predecessors
  -event EVENT		Set the event/tournament name to EVENT
  -games N		Play N games per encounter. This value should be set to
			an even number in tournaments with more than two players
			to make sure that each player plays an equal number of
			games with white and black pieces.
  -rounds N		Multiply the number of rounds to play by N.
			For two-player tournaments this option should be used
			to set the total number of games to play.
  -sprt elo0=ELO0 elo1=ELO1 alpha=ALPHA beta=BETA
			Use a Sequential Probability Ratio Test as a termination
			criterion for the match. This option should only be used
			in matches between two players to test if engine A is
			stronger than engine B. Hypothesis H1 is that A is
			stronger than B by at least ELO0 ELO points, and H0
			(the null hypothesis) is that A is not stronger than B
			by at least ELO1 ELO points. The maximum probabilities
			for type I and type II errors outside the interval
			[ELO0, ELO1] are ALPHA and BETA. The match is stopped if
			either H0 or H1 is accepted or if the maximum number of
			games set by '-rounds' and/or '-games' is reached.
  -ratinginterval N	Set the interval for printing the ratings to N games
  -debug		Display all engine input and output
  -openings file=FILE format=FORMAT order=ORDER plies=PLIES start=START policy=POLICY

			Openings will be picked in the order specified by ORDER,
			which can be either 'random' or 'sequential' (default).

			mode START is the number of the first opening that will
			be played. The minimum value for START is 1 (default).
			The POLICY rules when to shift to a new opening.
			It can be one of 'encounter'- which uses a new
			opening for any new pair of players, 'round'- which
			shifts only for a new round, or 'default'- which shifts
			for any new pair of players and also when the number of
			opening repetitions is reached.

			finished games are saved for argument 'fi'.
  -epdout FILE		Save the end position of the games to FILE in FEN format.
  -recover		Restart crashed engines instead of stopping the match
  -repeat [N]		Play each opening twice (or N times). Unless the -noswap
