/*!
 * \brief The EngineConfigurationModel class represents a chess engine
 * configuration based model.
 *
 * %EngineConfigurationModel is the \e model part in the Model-View
 * architecture.
 *
 * The model contains the data providing view classes access to it. When the
 * model is updated (either from the view or by calling methods), all the
 * views are notified about the updates.
 *
 * %EngineConfigurationModel is a \e list based model; its items don't have
 * parent-child relationship.
 *
 * Almost all of the method calls are inherited from \e QAbstractItemModel. Refer
 * to QAbstractItemModel's documentation for better overview of each method.
