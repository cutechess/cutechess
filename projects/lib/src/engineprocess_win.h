 * \brief A replacement for QProcess on Windows
 *
 * Due to polling, QProcess' response times on Windows are too slow for
 * chess engines. EngineProcess is a different implementation which reads
 * new data immediately (no polling) when it's available. The interface is
 * the same as QProcess' with some unneeded features left out.
 *
 * On non-Windows platforms EngineProcess is just a typedef to QProcess.
