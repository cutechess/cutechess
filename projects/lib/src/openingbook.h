 * \brief A collection of opening moves for chess.

 * OpeningBook is a container (binary tree) class for opening moves that
 * can be played by the GUI. When the game goes "out of book", control
 * of the game is transferred to the players.
 *
 * The opening book can be stored externally in a binary file. When it's needed,
 * it is loaded in memory, and positions can be found quickly by searching
 * the book for Zobrist keys that match the current board position.
