		 * Adds a new game to the game manager.

		 * This function gives control of \a game to the game manager,

		 * the game is played in a separate thread, it must not have a
		 * parent object. When it's not needed anymore, it must be
		 * destroyed with the \a deleteLater() method. Only then will the
		 * game manager free the game slot used by the game.
		 *
		 * Construction of the players is delayed to the moment when the
		 * game starts. If the same builder objects (\a white and \a black)
		 * were used in a previous game, the players are reused instead of
		 * constructing new players.
		 *
		 * If \a mode is StartImmediately, the game starts immediately
		 * even if the number of active games is over the \a concurrency
		 * limit. In \a Enqueue mode the game is started as soon as
		 * a free game slot is available.
		 *
		 * \a cleanupMode determines whether the players and their builder
		 * objects are destroyed or reused after the game.
		 *
		 * If the game cannot be started because one or both of the players
		 * can't be initialized, \a game will emit the startFailed() signal.
		 *
		 * \note If there are still free game slots after starting this
		 * game, the ready() signal is emitted immediately.
