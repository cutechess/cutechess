 * \brief A node in the ECO tree (Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings)
 *
 * The EcoNode class can be used to generate and query a database (a tree) of
 * known chess openings that belong to the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
 * More about ECO: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_of_Chess_Openings
 *
 * The ECO tree can be generated from a PGN collection or from a binary file
 * that's part of the cutechess library (the default). A node corresponding
 * to a PgnGame can be found by traversing the ECO tree as new moves are added
 * to the game, or by passing all the moves at once to the find() function.
 *
 * \note The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings only applies to games of standard
 * chess that start from the default starting position.
