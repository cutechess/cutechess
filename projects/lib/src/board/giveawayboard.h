 * \brief A board for Giveaway Chess, a Losing Chess variant (ICC wild 26)
 *
 * The side that has no legal moves wins, either by losing all pieces or
 * by being stalemated.
 *
 * The king has no royal powers, so there is no check and the king can be
 * captured. Pawns can also promote to king. Castling is allowed.
 * If a side can capture then they must make a capture move.
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_chess
 *
 * \sa AntiBoard
 * \sa SuicideBoard
 *
 * GiveawayBoard uses Polyglot-compatible zobrist position keys,
 * so adequate opening books in Polyglot format can be used.
 *
 * \note Standard Chess Rules: http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article
