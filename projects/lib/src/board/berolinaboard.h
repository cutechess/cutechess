 * \brief A board for Berolina Chess
 *
 * Berolina chess is a variant of standard chess with modified pawn moves.
 * Pawns move one square diagonally forward and they capture one square straight ahead.
 * Introduced by Edmund Nebermann, Berlin 1926.
 *
 * \note Rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berolina_chess
 *
 * BerolinaBoard uses Polyglot-compatible zobrist position keys,
 * so Berolina opening books in Polyglot format could be used.
 *
 * \note Standard Chess Rules: http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article
