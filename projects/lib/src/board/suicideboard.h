 * \brief A board for Suicide Chess, a Losing Chess variant
 *
 * Suicide Chess is a variant of Losing Chess (FICS Suicide).
 *
 * The king has no royal powers, so there is no check and the king can be
 * captured. Pawns can also promote to king. Castling is not allowed.
 * If a side can capture then they must make a capture move.
 *
 * The side that has lost all pieces wins. If a side cannot move (stalemate)
 * then the side with less pieces wins and else the game is drawn.
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_chess
 *
 * \sa AntiBoard
 * \sa GiveawayBoard
 *
 * SuicideBoard uses Polyglot-compatible zobrist position keys,
 * so adequate opening books in Polyglot format can be used.
 *
 * \note Standard Chess Rules: http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article
