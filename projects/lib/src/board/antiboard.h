/*!
 * \brief A board for Losing Chess, LC1 (main variant, international rules)
 * a.k.a Antichess
 *
 * Losing Chess is a variant of standard chess but has a different aim.
 *
 * The side that has no legal moves wins, either by losing all pieces or
 * by being stalemated.
 *
 * The king has no royal powers, so there is no check and the king can be
 * captured. Pawns can also promote to king. Castling is not allowed.
 * If a side can capture then they must make a capture move.
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_chess#Rules_.28main_variant.29
 *
 * Losing Chess is believed to be several centuries old.
 * Giveaway Chess and Suicide Chess are variants of Losing Chess.
 * \sa GiveawayBoard
 * \sa SuicideBoard
 *
 * AntiBoard uses Polyglot-compatible zobrist position keys,
 * so adequate opening books in Polyglot format can be used.
 *
 * \note Standard Chess Rules: http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article
