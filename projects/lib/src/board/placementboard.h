/*!
 * \brief A board for Placement Chess, a Shuffle-Chess variant
 * (a.k.a. Pre-Chess, Meta-Chess, Bronstein Chess, Benko Chess)
 *
 * This game was proposed by several authors like David Bronstein,
 * USSR ~1948, and Pal Benk√∂, USA 1978.
 *
 * Placement Chess follows the rules of standard chess but each side begins
 * only with their Pawns on their second rank. Then the players take turns
 * to place their pieces freely on the base rank. There is one restriction:
 * any side must place their Bishops on squares with different colours.
 *
 * After all pieces have been placed White makes the first move.
 * There are 2880*2880 opening positions.
 *
 * Castling rights are established only for Kings on the e-file and for
 * Rooks on corner squares.
 *
 * \note: Set-up phase with alternating white and black piece drops.
 *
 * \sa StandardBoard
 * \sa FrcBoard
