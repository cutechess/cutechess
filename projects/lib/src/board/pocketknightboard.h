 * \brief A board for Pocket Knight Chess
 *
 * Pocket Knight Chess is a variant of standard chess.
 * Each side has an additional Knight in their reserve that can be
 * dropped onto an empty square during the game instead of making a
 * normal move.
 *
 * This variant originates from the early 20th century and is also known
 * under the name Tombola Chess.
