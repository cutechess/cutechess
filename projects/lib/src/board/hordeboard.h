 * \brief A board for Horde Chess and Dunsany's Chess
 * (Defaults are set to lichess.org (SF) variant)
 *
 * Horde chess is a variant of standard chess with different setup.
 * It is similar to a variant introduced by Lord Dunsany in 1942.
 *
 * The black side plays with a standard set of pieces. However white has
 * 36 pawns and no other pieces.
 *
 * White has to mate the black king, black has to capture all pawns of the
 * white horde in order to win. Standard chess rules apply. White pawns on
 * the first and second ranks can make a double step.
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsany%27s_chess#Horde_Chess
 *
 * HordeBoard uses Polyglot-compatible zobrist position keys,
 * so Horde Chess opening books in Polyglot format can be used.
 *
 * \note Standard Chess Rules: http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article
 * \sa PolyglotBook
