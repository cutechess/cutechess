/*!
 * \brief A board for Grand Chess
 *
 * Grand Chess is a variant of standard chess on a 10 x 10 board with
 * Capablanca chess pieces. This game was introduced in 1984 by Christian
 * Freeling, The Netherlands.
 *
 * Each side has one Cardinal (Archbishop, Bishop+Knight) and one Marshal
 * (Chancellor, Rook+Knight) in addition to the standard pieces.
 * GrandBoard uses the Capablanca names Archbishop and Chancellor.
 *
 * Initially each side has *ten* pawns on their third ranks. Most of the
 * other pieces start on their second ranks. The rooks are placed at
 * the corners. Castling is not allowed in Grand Chess.
 *
 * Pawns can make an initial double step and can be captured en passant.
 * When reaching their eigth or ninth ranks pawns can optionally be
 * promoted. Pawns can only promote to an own captured piece. On the tenth
 * rank a pawn *must* be promoted. If promotion is impossible, then the
 * pawn cannot advance to the tenth rank. It can give check to a king on
 * the end rank nevertheless.
 *
