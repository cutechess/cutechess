 * \brief A wrapper for probing Gaviota endgame tablebases.
 *
 * Gaviota tablebases are heavily compressed tables that contain the
 * expected result and "distance to mate" information for positions
 * where only 3-5 pieces are left on the board. The tablebases can be
 * used to adjudicate games or to provide perfect play in endgame
 * positions. Gaviota tablebases can only be used in standard chess
 * and Fischer Random chess.
