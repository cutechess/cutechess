/*!
 * \brief A board for Sit-tu-yin (Myanmar Traditional Chess, Burmese Chess)
 *
 * Sittuyin is the traditional variant of chess in Myanmar.
 * It is an old game (9th century) closely related to Makruk and Chaturanga.
 * There has been a wide variety of local or temporary rules.
 *
 * Each side begins with four Pawns on the left side on their third rank and
 * four Pawns on the right side on their fourth rank.
 *
 * In the initial phase of the game the red side places their pieces behind
 * their Pawns. After that the black side places their pieces. Rooks must be
 * placed on the back rank. After all pieces have been placed the red side
 * makes their first move.
 *
 * Sittuyin pieces move like Makruk (Thai Chess) pieces: The movements of
 * King, Rook, Knight, and Pawn are the same as in Makruk, Shatranj, and
 * chess. There are no "modern" moves: no pawn double steps, and no castling.
 * The General moves one square diagonally. The Elephant has the same move-
 * ment but can also make a step straight forward.
 *
 * If a side has no General then a Pawn can be promoted to General. This
 * can only be done by a side's last Pawn or within the opponent's half from
 * a square that is part of a main diagonal. Promotion counts as a move of
 * its own. When promoting the Pawn either remains on its current square or
 * makes a General's move. The promotion move must not give check or capture
 * an opponent piece. Pawn promotion is optional, not oligatory: The Pawn
 * can also make a normal move or capture.
 *
 * Checkmating the opponent King wins. Stalemate is a draw. A draw can be
 * claimed if no pawns have been moved and no captures have been made for
 * fifty consecutive moves. A game will be drawn if it is impossible for
 * the remaining pieces to give mate. There is no 3-fold repetition rule.
 *
 * Endgames with King and Rook, or King, Elephant and General, or King,
 * Knight and General against a lone King must be won within a defined number
 * of moves, else the game is drawn.
 *
 * \note Rules: The Official Rules by the Myanmar Chess Federation
 * (as described by Maung Maung Lwin).
 * \note: Set-up phase with alternating red and black piece drops.
