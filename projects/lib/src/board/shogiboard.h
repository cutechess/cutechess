/*!
 * \brief A board for Shogi
 *
 * Shōgi is a Japanese form of chess where captured
 * pieces can be brought back ("dropped") into the game,
 *
 * It is played on a 9x9 board. The piece set traditionally consists of
 * flat five-sided pieces with their names written on them. Such sets
 * have been in use at least since the 11th century AD.
 *
 * Shōgi emerged from the earlier game of Shō Shōgi by the reinsertion
 * of captured pieces as own pieces (15th century AD) and removal of the
 * Drunk Elephant piece by imperial order (16th century AD).
 *
 * Shōgi has eight types of original pieces. Either side starts with a
 * set of 9 x Pawn (on the third rank), 2 x Lance, 2 x Knight, 2 x Silver
 * (General), 2 x Gold (General), 1 x Bishop, 1 x Rook, 1 x King.
 * The latter three types move like in standard chess. The Pawn moves and
 * captures 1 square straight forward. The Lance moves and captures like
 * a Rook, but only forwards. Similarly, the Knight leaps like a chess
 * Knight, but only in the two forward directions. The Silver goes one
 * square diagonally or forward (5 moves). The Gold goes like a King but
 * not diagonally backward (6 moves).
 *
 * All these pieces except King and Gold General have the option to promote
 * if their move starts or ends in the opponent's third of the board.
 * A Pawn or Lance reaching the highest rank must promote. A Knight must
 * promote when reaching the highest two ranks. All promoted Pawns, Lances,
 * Knights, and Silvers move like Gold Generals. A promoted Bishop moves
 * like Bishop or King, a promoted Rook like Rook or King.
 *
 * A captured piece switches sides and goes into the hand of the capturing
 * side. Promoted pieces change back to their original types. A player may
 * drop a piece in hand onto an empty square of the board. This counts as a
 * move. Pawns, Lances, and Knights must not be dropped onto the highest
 * ranks where they would be unable to move. Pawns must not be dropped onto
 * files with own Pawns and must not be dropped to give mate immediately.
 *
 * A side must avert an attack on their King (check, ote 王手) immediately.
 * It is forbidden to enter check. If there is no legal move to avert check
 * then the side in check loses by checkmate (tsumi 詰み).
 *
 * When a game position occurs four times with the same player to move and
 * the same pieces in hand for each player the game is drawn by repetition
 * (sennichite, 千日手). If the situation has arisen from a perpetual check
 * then the side giving check loses.
 *
