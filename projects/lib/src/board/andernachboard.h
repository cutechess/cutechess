 * \brief A board for Andernach Chess
 *
 * Andernach chess is a variant of standard chess with modified captures.
 * Capturing pieces - except for kings - change sides. A pawn capturing on
 * the final rank is promoted first and then changes sides.
 *
 * The game was introduced in 1993 during a tournament in Andernach, Germany.
 * It was suggested by H. P. Rehm and evolved from Double Tibetian Chess.
 * It is a popular variant in problem chess.
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andernach_chess
 *
 * AndernachBoard uses Polyglot-compatible zobrist position keys,
 * so appropriate books in Polyglot format can be used.
 *
 * \note Standard Chess Rules: http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article
