 * \brief A board for Dōbutsu shōgi (どうぶつしょうぎ, Animal Chess)
 *
 * Dōbutsu shōgi is a simplified variant of shōgi for young children which
 * is played on a board with 3 files and 4 ranks. Many shōgi rules apply in
 * this variant. The pieces move like in standard shōgi but moves are limited
 * to the range of one square. There are captures by displacement but no
 * concepts of check nor mate. Captured pieces switch sides and can be dropped
 * onto empty squares.
 *
 * Either side begins with one Lion (King) in the center of their base rank,
 * one Giraffe (Rook) to its right, one Elephant (Bishop) to its left,
 * and one Chick (Pawn) in front if it.
 *
 * The Chick promotes to a Hen (Tokin) after moving forward to highest rank.
 * The Hen moves like a Gold General in shōgi. A captured Hen can only be
 * dropped as a Chick but without further restrictions.
 *
 * The game is drawn if the players play the same position three turns in a
 * row. Perpetual checks are allowed.
 *
 * Capturing the opponent's Lion wins. The Lion reaching the opponent's base
 * rank wins if the Lion cannot be captured immediately.
 *
 * Dōbutsu shōgi was introduced in 2009 by Madoka Kitao, Japan
