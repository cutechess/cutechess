 * \brief A board for Extinction Chess
 *
 * Extinction Chess (Survival of the Species by R. W. Schmittberger, USA,
 * 1985) is a variant of standard chess but has a different objective.
 *
 * A side wins if their opponent loses all pieces of any kind.
 *
 * The king has no royal obligation, so there is no check and the king
 * can be captured. Pawns can also promote to king. Castling is allowed.
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_chess
 *
 * ExtinctionBoard uses Polyglot-compatible zobrist position keys,
 * so adequate opening books in Polyglot format can be used.
 *
 * \note Standard Chess Rules: http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article

 * \brief A board for Kinglet Chess
 *
 * Kinglet (V. R. Parton, UK 1953) is a standard chess variant similar to
 * Extinction Chess. There are two differences:
 *
 * A side wins if their opponent loses all pawns (by capture or promotion).
 * Pawns can only promote to king.
 *
 * The king has no royal obligation, so there is no check and the king can
 * be captured. Castling is allowed. Stalemate is a draw.
