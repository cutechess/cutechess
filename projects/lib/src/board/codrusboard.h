/*!
 * \brief A board for the Game of Codrus, a Losing Chess variant
 *
 * The Game of Codrus is a predecessor of Losing Chess.
 *
 * The King has no royal powers, so there is no check and the King can be
 * captured. Castling is allowed. If a side can capture then they must make
 * a capture move.
 *
 * The side whose King is captured wins.
 *
 * The Game of Codrus has been described in J. Brede's Alamanach, Denmark 1844.
 * It is named after the Athenian King Codrus who sacrificed himself to save
 * his people (1068 BC).
 *

 * Altona, (then) Denmark: J. F. Hammreich. p. 82f (in German language).
