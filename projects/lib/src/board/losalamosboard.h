 * \brief A board for Los Alamos chess
 *
 * Los Alamos chess is a variant of standard chess which is played on a
 * 6x6 board. This variant has no bishops, no pawn double steps, and no
 * castling. It was introduced in 1956 by Paul Stein, Mark Wells, and
 * others with the first chess-like program on the MANIAC I computer of
 * Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
