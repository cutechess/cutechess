 * \brief A board for Racing Kings Chess
 *
 * Racing Kings Chess (originally named Dodo Chess) is a variant of standard
 * chess by Vernon R. Parton, UK, 1961.
 *
 * This race game is played without pawns. The starting position has pieces on
 * ranks one and two. Moving the king to the eighth rank wins. However, the
 * game is drawn when the black king reaches the eighth rank immediately after
 * the white king. Giving check and entering check is forbidden.
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._R._Parton#Racing_Kings
