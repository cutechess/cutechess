 * \brief A board for Grid Chess
 *
 * Grid Chess is a variant of standard chess with an additional rule.
 * The board is divided into 16 quadratic regions of 2x2 squares.
 * Moves within a region are forbidden.
 *
 * As a consequence a piece cannot be captured or protected from inside
 * its own region. A king cannot be checked from inside his own region.
 *
 * Introduced by Walter Stead in 1952.
