 * \brief A board for Janus Chess
 *
 * Janus Chess is a variant of standard chess which adds the Janus
 * piece type (Bishop + Knight). Like Capablanca Chess it is played
 * on a 10x8 board.
 *
 * Initially the Jani are positioned between Rooks and Knights. The
 * King castles from E-file to either B- or I-file, the corresponding
 * rook to C- or H-file.
 *
 * Introduced by Werner Sch√∂ndorf, Germany, 1978.
