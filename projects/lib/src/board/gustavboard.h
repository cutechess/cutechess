 * \brief A board for Gustav III's Chess
 *
 * This variant of chess on a 10x8 board was attributed to King Gustav III
 * of Sweden. In addition to the standard chess arrangement each side has
 * two additional Adjutant-Generals (Amazon, Q+N). They start from extra
 * corner squares outside of the Rooks. The outermost files of the board only
 * consist of these corner squares, so there are 64 plus 4 squares in total.
 *
 * Standard chess rules apply. A Pawn can promote to Adjutant-General.
 *
 * \note Rules: http://mlwi.magix.net/bg/gustaviii.htm
