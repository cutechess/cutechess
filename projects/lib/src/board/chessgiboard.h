 * \brief A board for Chessgi
 *
 * Chessgi differs from Loop Chess only in one rule: a side may
 * also drop pawns onto their first rank. The name Chessgi was
 * introduced by Ralph Betza in order to stress its similarities
 * to both Chess and Shogi. Alias names are Drop Chess, Mad Mate,
 * Neo-Chess, among others.
