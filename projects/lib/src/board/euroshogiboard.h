/*!
 * \brief A board for EuroShogi
 *
 * EuroShogi is a variant of Shogi which is played on a 8x8 board.
 * In this variant either side begins with King, two (Gold) Generals,
 * two Bishops (on squares of different colours), two Knights, one Rook
 * (on 2nd rank), and eight Pawns on the third rank. Shogi rules apply.
 *
 * A Knight leaps like a chess Knight, but only in the two forward directions.
 * In contrast to Shogi, a Knight can also move one square sideways.
 * Therefore Knights can be dropped on any empty square of the board.
 *
 * The promotion zone consists of the three furthest ranks.
 * In case of a position occurring for the third time with the same player
 * to move and the same pieces in hands, the game is drawn. However,
 * if this situation arises from a series of checks, the side giving
 * perpetual check loses the game.
 *
 * EuroShogi was introduced in 2000 by Vladim√≠r Pribylinec.
 *
 * \note Rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroshogi
