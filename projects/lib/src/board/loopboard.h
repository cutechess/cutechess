 * \brief A board for Loop Chess
 *
 * Loop Chess is a variant of standard chess where captured
 * pieces can be brought back ("dropped") into the game by
 * the capturing side, similar to Shogi and Crazyhouse.
 * Promoted pieces keep their ranks when captured. Pawns must
 * not be dropped on the first and the eighth rank.
