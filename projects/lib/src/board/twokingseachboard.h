 * \brief A board for Two Kings Each Chess (or Wild 9)
 *
 * Two Kings Each is a variant of standard chess with two kings on both
 * sides. The kings' roles depend on the position. Only the king that is
 * closer to the a-file is royal and it is exposed to check and mate.
 * If the kings are on the same file the king closer to (White's) first
 * rank is royal. The other king is a normal piece and can be captured.
 * Giving mate to the royal king wins.
 *
 * Introduced on the ICC as wild/9.
 * \note Rules: https://www.chessclub.com/user/help/wild9
