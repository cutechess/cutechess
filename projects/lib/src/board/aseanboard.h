/*!
 * \brief A board for ASEAN-Chess
 *
 * ASEAN-Chess is a standardised variant of chess defined by the ASEAN Chess
 * Confederation. It is based both on standard chess and Makruk.
 *
 * ASEAN-Chess is played on a standard chess board. The pieces are named as in
 * standard chess, but have the movements of Makruk. So the Queen has the
 * movement of the Met (Ferz, 1 square diagonally), and the Bishop moves like
 * the Khon in Makruk (or the Silver General in Shogi): 1 square diagonally or
 * 1 square straight forward. There is no castling and pawns have no initial
 * double steps.
 *
 * The starting position has the pawns on the third own rank, like in Makruk.
 * However, the pieces on the base rank are placed in the starting order of
 * standard chess. Pawns promote on the eighth rank to either Queen, Rook,
 * Bishop, or Knight.
 *
 * Like in standard chess giving mate wins, stalemate is a draw, insufficient
 * material is a draw, and after fifty consecutive moves without any pawn move
 * and any capture a draw can be claimed. However, three-fold repetition of a
 * move does not achieve a draw. A game is drawn when no side can be checkmated
 * at all by any sequence of legal moves.
 *
 * When a King is left without any pieces the material on the board is evalua-
 * ted at once. The stronger side must give mate within 16 moves if they have
 * a Rook. If they have a Bishop and a Queen the limit is 44 moves. If they
 * have a Knight and a Queen the limit is 64 moves.
 *
