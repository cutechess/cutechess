 * \brief A wrapper for probing Syzygy endgame tablebases.
 *
 * Syzygy tablebases are heavily compressed tables that contain the
 * expected result and "distance to zero" information for positions
 * where only 2-6 pieces are left on the board. The tablebases can be
 * used to adjudicate games or to provide perfect play in endgame
 * positions. The Syzygy tablebases take the 50-move-rule into account.
 * Syzygy tablebases can only be used in standard chess and Fischer
 * Random chess.
