 * \brief A board for Chigorin Chess
 *
 * Chigorin Chess is a variant of standard chess where the
 * white side has no pieces with Bishop movement but four
 * Knights and one Chancellor with Rook and Knight movements.
 * Black has no pieces with Knight movement but four Bishops
 * and one Queen. Pawn promotion is only allowed to the piece
 * types that a side had at the start of the game (with the
 * exceptions of Pawn and King).
 *
 * This variant was introduced by Ralph Betza in 2002
 *
 * \note Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chigorin_Chess
