/*!
 * \brief A board for Makruk (Thai Chess)
 *
 * Makruk Chess is a variant of chess popular and with a long tradition
 * in Thailand. It is very similar to Ouk Cha Trang (Cambodian Chess).
 *
 * The Pawn, Knight, Rook, Ferz, and King are all traditional pieces with
 * movements known from Chaturanga and Shatranj. In Makruk these pieces
 * are named differently (with other meanings).
 *
 * The Elephant (Gaja, Alfil) was replaced by the Khon (Base) which moves
 * like Shogi's Silver General: 1 square diagonally or 1 square forward.
 * Met is the Thai name of the Ferz which only moves 1 square diagonally.
 *
 * Makruk has no Pawn double step option and no castling. When reaching the
 * own sixth rank a Pawn (Bia, shell) is promoted to Ferz (Met, grain).
 *
 * Like in standard chess giving mate wins, stalemate is a draw, and two bare
 * kings is a draw. If there is (obviously) not enough material to force a win,
 * the game will be drawn.
 *
 * There is no fifty-move rule. When the last Pawn on the board is captured
 * or promoted the game must be won within 64 moves else the game is drawn.
 *
 * A new counting overrides when there are no Pawns on the board and a side
 * is left with no pieces besides their "bare" King. The starting count equals
 * 1 plus the number of pieces.
 *
 * The counting limit depends on the stronger side:
 * If they have 2 Rooks (with or without other pieces) it is 8 moves,
 * 1 Rook: 16 moves, 2 Khons: 22 moves, 2 Knights: 32 moves, 1 Khon: 44 moves,
 * else 64 moves. When the count *exceeds* the limit the game is drawn.
 * There is no counting as long as there are any unpromoted pawns on the board.
 *
 * Example: For KRRNP vs K the weaker side will count their moves 7 (= 1 + 6)
 * and 8 (the limit defined by 2 Rooks), and if they have a legal move at
 * count 9 the game will end in a draw.
 *
 * \note Rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makruk_chess
 *
 * \sa ShatranjBoard
 * \sa OukBoard
 *
 * \note This implementation can read and write positions in FEN standard
 * notation and per default an adapted FEN notation where the fields have
 * Makruk/Ouk specific meanings to support the counting rules:
 * The castling field is present but unused in Makruk - it is used for initial
 * move status in Ouk. The en passant field "-" is replaced by the active
 * Makruk counting limit in plies. The half move count gives a ply count
 * according to endgame counting rules instead of the reversible ply count
 * of standard chess.
