 * \brief A thread class for reading input from a child process
 *
 * PipeReader is intended for reading input from chess engines in Windows.
 * It uses blocking read calls to read from a WinAPI pipe, and
 * sends the readyRead() signal when a new line of text data is available.
 *
 * No event loops are used. The child process has to terminate or be
 * terminated before the pipe reader can exit cleanly.
 *
 * \note This class is for Windows only
 * \sa EngineProcess
