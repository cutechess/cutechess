 * \brief Evaluation data for a chess move.
 *
 * Before chess engines send their move they usually print information
 * about the moves they're thinking of, how many nodes they've searched,
 * the search depth, etc. This class stores that information so that it
 * could be saved in a PGN file or displayed on the screen.
 *
 * From human players we can only get the move time.
