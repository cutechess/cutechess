players to make sure that each player plays an equal number of games with white
and black pieces.
.It Fl rounds Ar n

.Ar n .
For two-player tournaments this option should be used to set the total
number of games to play.

.Pp
This option should only be used in matches between two players to test if
engine P1 is stronger than engine P2.
Hypothesis H1 is that P1 is stronger than P2 by at least
.Ar E0

.Ss Engine Options
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic conf Ns = Ns Ar arg
Use an engine with the name
.Ar arg
from engine configuration file.
.It Ic name Ns = Ns Ar arg
Set the name to
.Ar arg .
.It Ic cmd Ns = Ns Ar arg
Set the command to
.Ar arg .
.It Ic dir Ns = Ns Ar arg
Set the working directory to
.Ar arg .
.It Ic stderr Ns = Ns Ar arg
Redirect standard error output to file
.Ar arg .
.It Ic proto Ns = Ns [ Cm uci | Cm xboard  Ns ]
Set the chess protocol.
.It Ic tc Ns = Ns [ Ns Ar tcformat | Cm inf Ns ]
Set the time control.
The format is moves/time+increment,
where
.Ar moves
is the number of moves per tc,
.Ar time
is time per tc (either seconds or minutes:seconds),
and
.Ar increment
is the time increment per move in seconds.
.Pp
Infinite time control can be set with
.Cm inf .
.It Ic option. Ns Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
Set custom engine option.
.It Ic arg Ns = Ns Ar arg
Pass
.Ar arg
to the engine as a command line argument.
.It Ic initstr Ns = Ns Ar arg
Send
.Ar arg
to the engine's standard input at startup.
.It Ic restart Ns = Ns [ Cm auto | Cm on | Cm off Ns ]
Set the engine restart mode.
.Cm auto
means the engine decides whether to restart (default),
.Cm on
means the engine is always restarted between games and
.Cm off
means the engine is never restarted between games.
Setting this option does not prevent engines from being restarted between
rounds in a tournament featuring more than two engines.
.It Ic trust
Trust result claims from the engine without validation.
By default all claims are validated.
.It Ic st Ns = Ns Ar n
Set the time limit for each move to
.Ar n
seconds.
This option cannot be used in combination with the
.Ic tc
option.
.It Ic timemargin Ns = Ns Ar n
Let engines go
.Ar n
milliseconds over the time limit.
.It Ic book Ns = Ns Ar file
Use
.Ar file
(Polyglot book file) as the opening book.
.It Ic bookdepth Ns = Ns Ar n
Set the maximum book depth (in fullmoves) to
.Ar n .
.It Ic whitepov

This option should be used with engines that always report scores from white's
perspective.
.It Ic ponder
Enable pondering if the engine supports it.
.It Ic depth Ns = Ns Ar plies
Set the search depth limit.
.It Ic nodes Ns = Ns Ar count
Set the node count limit.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Play ten games between two Sloppy engines with a time control of 40
moves in 60 seconds:
.Pp
.Dl $ cutechess-cli \-engine cmd=sloppy -engine cmd=sloppy -each proto=xboard tc=40/60 -rounds 10
.Pp
Play a single game between Atak and Glaurung engines with a time
control of 40 moves in one minute and 30 seconds with one second
increment:
.Pp
.Dl $ cutechess-cli \-engine name=Atak cmd=Atak32.exe dir=C:\eatak proto=xboard -engine cmd=glaurung proto=uci option.Threads=1 -both tc=40/1:30+1
.Bl -bullet
.It
Use the name=Atak parameter because it's a Xboard protocol 1 engine
and doesn't tell its name.
.It
Use the dir=C:\eatak parameter to point the location of the executable.
.It
Glaurung can tell its name and is in the PATH variable so only the
command is needed.
.It
Set Glaurung to use 1 thread.
.It
Set the time control to 40 moves in one minute and 30 seconds with
one second increment.
.El
.Pp
Play a Round-Robin tournament between Fruit, Crafty, Stockfish and
Sloppy:
.Pp
.Dl $ cutechess-cli \-engine conf=Fruit -engine conf=Crafty -engine conf=Stockfish -engine conf=Sloppy -each tc=4 book=book.bin -games 2 -rounds 10 -repeat
.Bl -bullet
.It
Play two games per encounter,
effectively multiplying the number of games by 2.
.It
Play 10 times the minimum amount of rounds (3). So the total number
of rounds to play will be 30, and the total number of games 120.
.It
In each two-game encounter colors are switched between games and the
same opening line is played in both games.
