Cute Chess is a graphical user interface, command-line interface and a library
for playing chess. Cute Chess is written in C++ using the [Qt
framework](https://www.qt.io/).

Installing
----------

Binaries for both the GUI and the `cutechess-cli` command-line interface are available [here](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess/releases)

Compiling
---------

Cute Chess requires Qt 5.5 or greater, a compiler with C++11 support and `qmake`.

In the simplest case you only have to issue:

    $ qmake
    $ make

If you are using the Visual C++ compiler replace `make` with `nmake`.

Documentation is available as Unix manual pages in the `docs/` directory. API
documentation can be built by issuing `make doc-api` (requires [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/)).

Running
-------

The `cutechess-cli` program is run from the command line to play games between
chess engines. For example to play ten games between two Sloppy engines
(assuming `sloppy` is in PATH) with a time control of 40 moves in 60
seconds:

    $ cutechess-cli -engine cmd=sloppy -engine cmd=sloppy -each proto=xboard tc=40/60 -rounds 10

See `cutechess-cli -help` for descriptions of the supported options or manuals
for full documentation.

Translation
-----------

### Get involved

To help with translations, add a line after the last line of `cutechess.pro`,
in the following format:

    TRANSLATIONS += translations/cutechess_[language_code].ts

Then generate the translation file by running the command:

    $ lupdate cutechess.pro

There will be a new file pending for translation. Edit with Qt Linguist:

    $ linguist translations/cutechess_[language_code].ts

If new strings are added in source code, run `lupdate` to update corresponding
`.ts` files.

### Compiling translations

After finishing translation, generate the binary file with the command:

    $ lrelease translations/cutechess_[language_code].ts

There will be the final `.qm` file for GUI application. Place the GUI
executable under the same path of `translations` directory.
